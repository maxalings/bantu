Bantu

Bantu is a community-driven platform designed to help visually impaired individuals in Bali connect with local service providers. The platform fosters accessibility and inclusivity by enabling users to find help easily and empowering workers to showcase their services.

Features

For Users:
	•	Find Local Help/Workers
Search for assistance based on location, category, or key terms to find the right person for the job.
	•	Send Requests to Workers
Directly contact workers to request their services through an easy-to-use interface.

For Workers:
	•	Post Services
List your skills and services (e.g., cleaning, gardening, or tutoring) to attract potential clients.
	•	Receive and Approve Jobs
Review incoming service requests and approve tasks that fit your availability and expertise.

How It Works
	1.	Users search for workers using filters like location, category, or keywords.
	2.	Workers create service listings to advertise their offerings.
	3.	Users send service requests to workers, outlining their needs.
	4.	Workers review and approve jobs to finalize the arrangements.
